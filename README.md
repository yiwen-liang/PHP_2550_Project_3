## PHP2550 Project 3: Simulation Studies

### Evaluating the Performance of a Prediction Model in Different Population

${\color{gray}Posted: 12/03/2023}$

This is the 3rd project assignment of PHP2550 Practical Data Analysis course at Brown University (Fall 23).

In this project, our goal is to build a prediction model using the Framingham Heart Study data, hence to evaluate the performance of this model in the target population underlying the NHANES data.	The submitted report and the code used for this analysis will be available here. The dataset is not available to the public.
